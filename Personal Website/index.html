                    <p class = "white-box"> I'm building an interactive personal website using Three.js
                        to create immersive 3D experiences directly in the browser.
                        The website will allow users to explore different sections through
                        smooth transitions, 3D animations, and interactive elements,
                        making navigation feel like a dynamic journey!</p>

                    <p class = "white-box"> This website uses Three.js for 3D graphics,
                         WebGL for rendering, and JavaScript to handle interactivity.
                         To enhance animations, I‚Äôll integrate GSAP for smooth transitions
                          and motion. These tools will work together to offer a unique,
                          engaging, and interactive experience.</p>

                          The site will highlight key projects and personal milestones in
                           a visually engaging way, providing an interactive, user-focused
                           experience.</p>
